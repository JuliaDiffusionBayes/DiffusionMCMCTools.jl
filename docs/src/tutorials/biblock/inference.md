# Inference with `BiBlock`s
*****

!!! note "important"
    Make sure that you read the [preamble](@id tutorials_start) before you start reading this tutorial.

Another level of complication to a smoothing algorithm, somewhat orthogonal to blocking is addition of an inference step. Let's forget about blocking for this tutorial (we will come back to it the subsequent tutorial) and focus on inference only.

## The algorithm
---
```julia
customkernel(θ, scale=0.1) = θ .+ 2.0*scale*(rand()-0.5)

#=
    NOTE: this will appear to be completely unnecessary and coming out of the
    blue if you are not considering more complicated settings of mixed effect
    models. Looking up ahead into the definition of ... should be helpful if
    you want to understand what the function below is aiming to do.

    In here, we are just creating the most basic struture that is needed for
    setting parameters. It can be much more complex if blocking, multiple
    updates and/or mixed effect models were used.
